# paper-simulating-particle-motion-2025
This repository contains code and data used to generate results for a manuscript in preparation, developed during a 2025 Research Experience for Undergraduates in the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice University, titled “Simulating Particle Motion on Unstructured Meshes Using Inverse Isoparametric Mapping and Bilinear Interpolation.”

You will need to run the code within a Python environment. All scripts were tested using Python 3.12.

## Manuscript Codes
The scripts are listed in the order corresponding to their associated figures in the manuscript.
- `rk2.py`:
